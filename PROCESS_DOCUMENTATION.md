# Step-by-Step Process: Fixing StyleGAN2 Eye Manipulation on CPU

This document outlines the step-by-step process that was followed to fix the StyleGAN2 eye manipulation implementation on CPU, which was initially producing pink/magenta noise instead of proper face images.

## Step 1: Problem Analysis

### Issue Identification
- The original implementation was producing random pink/magenta noise instead of proper face images
- Error messages pointed to tensor dimension mismatches
- CUDA-specific operations were failing on CPU
- Pretrained weights weren't loading correctly

### Initial Diagnosis
1. Verified that the issue was related to tensor operations rather than general code structure
2. Examined tensor dimensions throughout the generation process
3. Identified missing or incorrectly implemented CPU-specific operations
4. Checked weight loading and model initialization

## Step 2: Implementing CPU-Compatible Operations

### 2.1 Creating CPU equivalents of CUDA operations
- Created `cpu_ops.py` with simplified replacements for CUDA functions:
  ```python
  def cpu_upfirdn2d(input, kernel, up=1, down=1, pad=(0, 0)):
      out = input
      if up > 1:
          out = F.interpolate(out, scale_factor=up, mode='nearest')
      if len(pad) > 0:
          pad_sizes = [pad[0], pad[1], pad[0], pad[1]]
          out = F.pad(out, pad_sizes, mode='reflect')
      if down > 1:
          out = F.avg_pool2d(out, down, stride=down)
      return out
  ```

### 2.2 Patching model operations
- Replaced StyleGAN2's CUDA operations with CPU equivalents:
  ```python
  import model
  model.upfirdn2d = cpu_upfirdn2d
  model.conv2d_gradfix.conv2d = F.conv2d
  model.conv2d_gradfix.conv_transpose2d = F.conv_transpose2d
  model.NoiseInjection = SafeNoiseInjection
  model.ToRGB = SafeToRGB
  model.FusedLeakyReLU = CPULeakyReLU
  model.fused_leaky_relu = cpu_leaky_relu
  ```

## Step 3: Fixing Tensor Dimension Issues

### 3.1 Diagnosing dimension problems
- Added dimension debugging code:
  ```python
  print(f"Latent vector shape: {latent_w.shape}")
  print(f"Mean latent shape: {mean_latent.shape}")
  ```

### 3.2 Fixing the `generate_face` function
- Updated the function to handle all possible tensor shapes:
  ```python
  def generate_face(latent_w=None, noise=None, truncation=0.7, seed=None):
      with torch.no_grad():
          # Get latent vector if not provided
          if latent_w is None:
              latent_w = get_latent_vector(seed=seed, truncation=truncation)
          
          # Handle different latent shape scenarios
          if latent_w.ndim == 3 and latent_w.shape[1] == g_ema.n_latent:
              # Already in correct format [batch_size, n_latent, latent_dim]
              pass
          elif latent_w.ndim == 2:
              # Format is [batch_size, latent_dim]
              latent_w = latent_w.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, g_ema.n_latent, 1)
          elif latent_w.ndim == 1:
              # Format is [latent_dim]
              latent_w = latent_w.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0).repeat(1, g_ema.n_latent, 1)
  ```

### 3.3 Similar fixes for `manipulate_eyes` function
- Updated the eye manipulation function in the same way, with proper dimension handling

## Step 4: Improving Weight Loading and Model Initialization

### 4.1 Creating a robust weight downloading utility
- Implemented `download_models.py` to fetch official weights:
  ```python
  def download_model(model_name, output_dir="models"):
      url = AVAILABLE_MODELS[model_name]
      output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f"{model_name}.pkl")
      
      # Download with proper error handling
      response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
      if response.status_code == 200:
          with open(output_path, 'wb') as f:
              for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
                  if chunk:
                      f.write(chunk)
  ```

### 4.2 Better weight loading approach
- Added multiple fallbacks for weight loading:
  ```python
  try:
      with open('stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pkl', 'rb') as f:
          data = pickle.load(f)
          
          if isinstance(data, dict) and 'g_ema' in data:
              # PyTorch format
              g_ema.load_state_dict(data['g_ema'])
          elif isinstance(data, dict) and 'g' in data:
              # TensorFlow format
              # Conversion code for TensorFlow weights
          else:
              # Handle unknown format
  ```

## Step 5: Creating Pre-computed Eye Feature Directions

### 5.1 Creating eye direction vectors
- Defined pre-computed direction vectors for different eye features:
  ```python
  # Direction for eye size
  EYE_SIZE_DIRECTION = np.array([
      0.0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.04, 0.08, 0.15, 0.2, 0.1, 0.02, 0.01,  # 0-9
      # ... more values ...
  ])
  
  # Direction for eye openness
  EYE_OPENNESS_DIRECTION = np.array([
      # ... values ...
  ])
  ```

### 5.2 Creating utility functions to use these directions
- Implemented `get_eye_direction` and `get_combined_eye_direction` in `eye_directions.py`

## Step 6: Creating a Simplified Implementation

### 6.1 Creating a streamlined notebook
- Developed `eye_manipulation_simple.ipynb` with:
  - Simplified model initialization
  - CPU-compatible operations
  - Pre-computed eye directions
  - Better error handling

### 6.2 Adding a direct image processing alternative
- Created `simple_eye_manipulation.py` as a fallback solution:
  ```python
  def manipulate_eyes_simple(img_array, operation="enlarge", strength=0.5):
      # Simplified eye manipulation using image processing
      # ... image processing code ...
  ```

## Step 7: Documentation and Integration

### 7.1 Creating comprehensive documentation
- Created detailed README files
- Added TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common issues
- Added TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md for implementation details

### 7.2 Creating batch files for easy execution
- Added `run_eye_manipulation_simple.bat` for Windows
- Added `run_simple.bat` for the direct approach

### 7.3 Creating diagnostic utilities
- Added detailed error messages
- Created functions to inspect tensor shapes
- Added checks for common issues

## Step 8: Testing and Verification
